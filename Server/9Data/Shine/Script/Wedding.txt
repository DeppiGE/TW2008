#Record	Wedding1	Welcome everyone to the wedding, please take your seats.	
#Record	Wedding2	Let us begin..	
#Record	Wedding3	Dearly beloved, we are virtually gathered here today...	
#Record	Wedding4	To join these two together in marriage.
#Record	Wedding5	Before we continue, does anybody protest to this marriage?	
#Record	Wedding6	Speak now... or it wont really matter either way.	
#Record	Wedding7	I see that the wedding is unopposed so we'll continue.	
#Record	Wedding8	Before us is a man and a woman (I think)	
#Record	Wedding9	Who wish to be joined for 'love'. (Or maybe it's the buff they want)	
#Record	Wedding10	Such a thing occurs only so often...	
#Record	Wedding11	... and so these times must take unnecessarily long.	
#Record	Wedding12	And now, some words from a talking book.	
#Record	Book1	We do promise to be there for eachother,	
#Record	Book2	through poison and disease...
#Record	Book3	through debuff and invulnerability.	
#Record	Book4	We'll stand side by side in support of eachother...	
#Record	Book5	and never give up no matter how outleveled the other becomes!
#Record	Book6	Through events and pvp...	
#Record	Book7	and all things in between...	
#Record	Book8	We'll stand by eachother (even if only for the buff)	
#Record	Book9	Nothing can seperate us once we accept.
#Record	Wedding13	Click on the book to finalize your vows to eachother.	
#Record	Wedding14	Congratulations to the new couple! Your friends may spam their AoEs at this time.	
#Record	Wedding15	Credits to Shizel for the low quality translation.
