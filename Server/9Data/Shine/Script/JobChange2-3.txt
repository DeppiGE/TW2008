#Record	FirstR0	Suspect? Who are you?		
#Record	FirstR1	That they ordered you here? In order to kill us all.		
#Record	FirstE2	You cool, my friend seemed not to give us friendship.		
#Record	FirstR3	Is that true? It out of here asap. It's very dangerous here.		
#Record	FirstE4	Probably guessed the bar. We are fleeing for their lives, plus another injured.		
#Record	FirstE5	Recovery of our people will soon catch up here any more.	
#Record	FirstR6	After 30 minutes if the reinforcements come, they can retreat ....		
#Record	FirstR7	They have to recover all back!		
				
#Record	SecondR0	We are also seriously wounded, there is no way to help you.		
#Record	SecondE1	If you're with us, you are more dangerous on the bad.

#Record	FifthR0	Is even worse than I imagined. Live up to now ....		
#Record	FifthR1	But they will continue to attack, if that could not withstand, I must take now to leave here as soon as possible.		
#Record	FifthE2	Pairs of A, bravery and reckless are two different things ah.		
				
#Record	SixthE0	Do not think the enemy will multiply??	
#Record	SixthR1	The enemy only seeded panic.		
#Record	SixthE2	Although more and more enemies, but the attacks are getting weaker. But it seems the enemy continues to grow.		
				
#Record	SeventhE0	Let's panic the enemy?	
#Record	SeventhR1	What did you say?

#Record	NinethE0	Ron, you hurt all right? Need some help?	
#Record	NinethR1	It does not matter, Aldrin. Even if I am one person can insist that one day it	
#Record	NinethE2	Is not it? Fortunately! There came again. The one person you can rely on confrontation.		
				
#Record	TenthR0	I just thought, Eidelin. This place we can build the training of new recruits, don't you think so?
