## Requirements

Minimum requirements for hosting and building your own server. For further details on setting up a server, please refer to our [documentation](https://doc.fiestaheroes.com/).

```bash
# Supported Operating Systems
- Windows Server: 2008 R2
- Windows: Vista SP2, 7 SP1

# Minimum Hardware Specifications
To ensure optimal performance, we recommend the following minimum hardware specifications:
- RAM: 8GB
- CPU: 4 cores / 4 threads
- Disk: 128GB

Please note that although the minimum storage requirement for the operating system can technically be lower, we highly recommend a minimum of 128GB for optimal performance.
```


You can also utilize newer installations of Microsoft SQL Server, provided that the version is equal to or greater than 2014. However, if you intend to use a version higher than 2014, you will need to host the databases on a separate machine. In such cases, it is important to ensure that you appropriately configure the ```_ServerInfo.txt``` file to establish the required connection to the databases located on the separate machine.
